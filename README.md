Hello my name is Ross I am a manual and automation tester. 

I am interested in Art, Music, Techology and all forms of cycling. 

I am currently learning the django framework, but look to move forward into learning more front-end heavy technologies. 

I am looking to colaborate and would love to be able to take part in any projects that would be happy to take me on. The more creative the better. 

You can reach me on my linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossfisherdesign/ or on instagram @1rossfisher1
